Dear Program Coordinator,

There are errors in the <%= @event.code %> (<%= @event.location %>) event data:

<%= @error_messages %>

As a result of these errors, the above people will not appear as participants of the event, to the organizers.

Please update the data as soon as possible, so the organizers can work with it (i.e., schedule talks).

Many thanks!
